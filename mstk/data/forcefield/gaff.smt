## This is an unofficial implementation of GAFF atom types based on AmberTools results and Table 1 in the following article:
## * Wang, J.; Wolf, R. M.; Caldwell, J. W.; Kollman, P. A.; Case, D. A. Development and Testing of a General Amber Force Field. Journal of Computational Chemistry 2004, 25 (9), 1157â€“1174. https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.20035.
## It covers the 35 basic atom types and 23 special atom types, plus atom type `s` and `hx`, not mentioned in the paper.
## Because of the special treatment for conjugated atoms, it requires GaffTyper typing engine.

## AmberTools does not strictly follow the description in the paper, especially for types 'na', 'nh', 's' and 'ha'.
## E.g. try molecules 'NC=C', 'C1=CC=C1N(C)', 'C1=CC=CO1' and check the types assigned for N and H atoms.
## When Antechamber disagrees with GAFF paper, this implementation follows AmberTools.

## A major discrepancy between this implementation and AmberTools is on 5-member aromatic rings.
## RDKit is used here for determining aromaticity, while AmberTools does not consider 5-member rings as aromatic.
## For carbon atoms in pyrrole and furan, AmberTools assign conjugated ring types, while this implementation will assign aromatic types.
## The aromatic atom types are mainly used to maintain the planer structure of aromatic rings. The definition here should work well for that purpose.

## Hybridization assignment is nasty. E.g. N in N-c1ccccc1 is SP2 hybridized, whereas P in P-c1ccccc1 is SP3 hybridized.
## N in N-C=C is considered as SP2 hybridized by RDKit, but it is not a strong planer structure.
## Therefore, hybridization is avoided if the type can be correctly assigned with other information.

c      [C;X3]=[O,S;X1]          ## SP2 C in C=O, C=S
